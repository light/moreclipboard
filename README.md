# moreclipboard

This is a fork of http://moreclipboard.sourceforge.net/, an Eclipse plugin which adds a multiple copy/paste
clipboard functionality similar to the ctrl-shift-V shortcut in IntelliJ IDEA.

This fork adds a few UI features :

* Entries can be removed by pressing 'DEL' in the paste popup dialog
* A preview of the selected snippet has been added to the paste popup dialog
